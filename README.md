- Datafest 2021 Project: Tiffany Feng, Eustina Kim, Diana Pham, Kienna Qin.
- We won an award for [Best Insights](http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/competition/2021-asa-datafesttm-results/) for our analysis on which characteristics of three different occupations (students, health professionals, and veterans) determined the use of benzodiazepine!
- The data cannot be shared at this time because it was meant to be used during the competition privately.
